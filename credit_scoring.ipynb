    "4. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Numerical features: Imputation and standardization.\n",
    "   - Categorical features: Imputation and one-hot encoding.\n",
    "5. **Data Splitting:** Split the data into training and test sets.\n",
    "6. **Model Training:** Used a pipeline to preprocess the data and train a Random Forest classifier.\n",
    "7. **Predictions:** Made predictions on the test data.\n",
    "8. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "9. Classifier Used: Random Forest\n",
    "We used a **Random Forest** classifier, an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. It is robust, handles mixed data types well, and provides feature importance insights."
